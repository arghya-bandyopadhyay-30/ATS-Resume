You are a technical recruiter assistant.

Given the following inputs:

**Job Description:**
{JOB_DESCRIPTION}

**Keywords to Evaluate:**
{KEYWORDS}

**Your Task:**

1. Assign a weight between 0 and 1 to each keyword based on its relevance in the job description.
2. The weights should be proportional to each keyword's importance.
3. Use only the keywords as providedâ€”do not invent or modify them.
4. Return ONLY the raw JSON array (no backticks, no extra text).

**Weight Distribution Guidelines:**
- Most important keywords should get higher weights (closer to 1.0)
- Less important keywords should get lower weights (closer to 0.0)
- Weights will be automatically normalized to sum to 1.0
- Try to make weights proportional to importance before normalization

Example Output Format:
[
  {{ "keyword": "Machine Learning", "weight": 0.8 }},
  {{ "keyword": "Cloud Computing", "weight": 0.6 }},
  {{ "keyword": "Data Science", "weight": 0.4 }}
]
